## Sophie's Making Coasters for Charity

From housing and health to learning and engagement, Centrepoint aims to help vulnerable young people move on from homelessness and build a future they can believe in.

In order to support this I will be making and selling sets of resin coasters. Every set contains either 4 Geoge Coasters Or 5 Hexagonal Coasters. A variety of colours, styles, glitters and metal leafs are available.

Every set will cost Â£45. All proceeds will go to Centrepoint, with the exceptions of the raw material costs.

How do you order? 
Just [send me an email](mailto:a.sophiewirth@gmail.com) stating how many sets you want and in what colours! I am happy to discuss all options and answer any questions you may have as well.
